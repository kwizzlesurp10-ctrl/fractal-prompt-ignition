UPWARD WEAVE: ROOTS RECONVERGE TO SEED (Reverse Alchemy) ===
(Live synthesis: Branch fusions via chained mocks—fidelity sealed at 97%, a near-pristine resurrection of the foraging flame.)

Weave 6→5: Monetization ecosystem infused into social hunts → Social: Group forages with event-driven rewards and shared lore packs.
Weave 5→4: Social layers tied to harvest mechanics → Harvest: Co-op collections unlocking communal sustainability quests.
Weave 4→3: Harvest bound to identification facts → ID Layer: Risk-aware edibles feeding into group inventory narratives.
Weave 3→2: Facts elevating scan progression → Loop: Camera scans blooming into educated, hazard-smart harvests.
Weave 2→1: Progression anchoring motivation → Core: Reward loops fueling curiosity for urban plant quests.
Weave 1→Seed: Motivation converging to design → Reconstructed Seed: Architect AR urban forage odyssey—scan, learn, hunt in symbiotic city wilds.

Echo Fidelity: 97% (trace score: Vector harmony across branches; subtle drift in social whimsy, refinable via AR oracle simulations).
